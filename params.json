{"name":"Frontend-goodness","tagline":"A streamlined frontend development system using Gulp, SASS, CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and Twitter Bootstrap","body":"Frontend Goodness\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis is a great way to work with newer frontend technologies while allowing\r\nyou to add any backend you want alongside it. It uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)\r\nto watch and build CoffeeScript and SASS for you as you work with AngularJS.\r\n\r\nWho Is This Template For\r\n========================\r\n\r\nIdeally this is a great starting point for someone who wants to build an\r\napplication using AngularJS written in CoffeeScript classes. The Gulpfile and\r\ncomponents all are setup for seamless angular development using the\r\n[ng-classify](https://github.com/CaryLandholt/ng-classify) approach. As well,\r\nit enables you to write SASS for your CSS which makes CSS development much\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - Because it's so useful.\r\n* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - Because it's the future of data-driven\r\n  front-end frameworks.\r\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - Because it makes writing all\r\n  things JavaScript easier.\r\n* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - For quick scaffolding.\r\n* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - Making writing CSS less painful.\r\n* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Tool to build all files and compile for production.\r\n* [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - Excellent web fonts.\r\n\r\nGetting Setup\r\n=============\r\n\r\nClone this repo where you want your project to live:\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:dansackett/frontend-goodness\r\n\r\nNext make sure you install nodeJS:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties\r\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\r\n    sudo apt-get update\r\n    sudo apt-get install nodejs\r\n\r\nNext install bower (It's recommended to install it globally):\r\n\r\n    sudo npm install -g bower gulp\r\n\r\nNext install the gulp packages we'll use for this repo:\r\n\r\n    sudo npm install\r\n\r\nNext install bower components:\r\n\r\n    bower install\r\n\r\nFinally, type:\r\n\r\n    gulp\r\n\r\nIf all was installed correctly, you will have a fully functional website setup\r\nwherever your local server instance is located.\r\n\r\nUsing this project\r\n==================\r\n\r\nTo work with this project, make sure you follow the steps above to set things\r\nup properly. Once setup, all you will need to do is open a terminal and run:\r\n\r\n    gulp\r\n\r\nThis will watch your `src/coffee` and `src/css` files (included nested\r\ndirectories one level deeper) and compile them as you update them. It will\r\nalso account for added files.\r\n\r\nTo customize the source and destination folders, open the `gulp_config.yaml` file and\r\nedit the items. There is a place for **additional** scripts as well that is\r\ncurrently commented out. By default gulp will find all of your bower packages and\r\nconcatenate them and minify them into a single file `dependencies.min.js` and `dependencies.min.css`\r\nrespectively. By passing additional scripts into the config object, you can\r\ninclude javascript, css, and font files into this minification process that\r\nare outside the scope of bower.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
